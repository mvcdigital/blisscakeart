  Hi! I'm Ricarda, owner of Bliss Cake Art. I'm a cake designer, with a passion
  for baking and a love of all things hand painted. 


  Starting while I was at school, I studied creative subjects such as Art and Photography which I excelled in. But behind the scenes, I was constantly baking for family and friends, experimenting with designs and recipes - mainly because of my own allergies! Being Coaliac and also allergic to nuts, meant I have always had to experiment making my own food. And from there was where my passion for creating a business that combined my two great loves - baking and art, came from.


  Here at Bliss Cake Art, I strive to create bespoke designs for people who want to celebrate any occasion with an edible piece of art. Starting from initial sketches, I work with people from the start of the design process to the finished piece, to create a cake to remember. Get in touch using the form or email address, to start your journey of making memories through cake!
