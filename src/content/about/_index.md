  Hi! I'm Ricarda, owner of Bliss Cake Art. I'm a cake designer, with a passion
  for baking and a love of all things hand painted, and inclusion of making
  cakes for all allergies.


  Starting while I was at school, I studied creative subjects such as Art and Photography which I excelled in. But behind the scenes, I was constantly baking for family and friends, experimenting with designs and recipes - mainly because of my own allergies! Being Coaliac and also allergic to nuts, meant I have always had to experiment making my own food. And from there was where my passion for creating a business that combined my two great loves - baking and art, came from.


  Here at Bliss Cake Art, I
